# P2P-Simulator
This is a network simulator written in Java for testing peer to peer algorithms.
Extend Node to write your app and use Network to run the simulation.
Take a look at GUINetworkTest(spp:TestNode) for a very simple example or GUIHashNodeTest(app:HashNode+Client) for a more interesting example of a distributed P2P hashtable.
