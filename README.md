# P2P-Simulator
This is a network simulator written in Java for testing peer to peer algorithms.<br>
Extend Node to write your application and use Network to run the simulation.<br>
Take a look at GUINetworkTest(app:TestNode) for a very simple example or GUIHashNodeTest(app:HashNode+Client) for a more interesting example of a distributed P2P hashtable.<br>
Here's a 9 second video of what the simulator looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqWg37RxnWg
